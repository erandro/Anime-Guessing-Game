# Hangman Anime Game (Word Guess Game) 

### Overview
This project is a word guess game when the user is guessing Anime shows.

### How does it work?
The game gives the user a blanked Anime show and the user needs to guess the word.
The user guess one character at the time. If the user guess 5 wrong characters - the user lost. If the user guess all characters of the Anime show the game gives a new word.

### Why does useful?
This is a great example of using basic vanilla javascript function for creating a game that has some dialog with the user. Most of the function are console.loging through the game and give the user a glance at what is happening in the code.

### How do the user play?
The game will start as soon as the user open the html page.

3. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

4. Display the following on the page:

5. Press any key to get started!

6. Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

   * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

   * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

7. Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

8. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).

9. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
