## How does it work

The game will start as soon as the user opens the HTML page. Instruction is on the page.

The game gives the user a blanked Anime show which the user needs to guess.
The user guesses one character at the time until the anime is revealed or the user got 5 wrong guesses. If 5 wrong characters were guessed- the user lost. If the user guesses all characters of the Anime, the user would get a point. Win or Lose- the game will generate a new anime show.
When guessing wrong a shadowed hint will appear on the screen (will be revealed if the user will guess the anime).

This is a great example for a basic game that has some dialog with the user. Most of the function are console.loging through the game and gives a glance at what is happening in the code.
